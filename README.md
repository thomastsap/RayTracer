# RayTracer

1. Programming language:  **C++**
2. Target Platform: **Windows**
3. Status: **Ongoing**

Motivated by [Minecraft with RTX](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/minecraft-with-rtx-beta-out-now-download-play/) i wanted to learn more about the techniques and the math used in ray tracing. To achieve that i am going to build a ray tracer.  In the process i'm going to upload images that decribe its current state.
